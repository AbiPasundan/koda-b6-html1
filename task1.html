        <h3 align="center">HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h3>
        <p autofocus>
          <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
          Web. 
          It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
          technologies <a href="./src/besides.html" target="_blank" >besides</a> <strong>HTML</strong> are generally used to describe a web page's
          appearance/presentation <i>CSS</i> or functionality/behavior <i>JavaScript</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <mark>Hypertext</mark> refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. 
        </p>

        <p>
            An <strong>HTML</strong> element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the < title > tag can be written as < Title >  < TITLE > , or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

        <h4>Basic HTML syntax</h4>
        <p>
            Covers the absolute basics of <strong>HTML</strong>, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical <strong>HTML</strong> page is structured and how an <strong>HTML</strong> element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some <strong>HTML</strong> to get you interested!

        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <!-- sub paragraph 2/2 -->
        <p>
            Lists are everywhere in life—from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! It may not surprise you that <strong>HTML</strong> has a convenient set of elements that allows us to define different types of list. On the web, we have three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and description lists. This lesson shows you how to use the different types.

        <h4>Headings and paragraphs</h4>
        <p>
            One of <strong>HTML's</strong> main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an <strong>HTML</strong> document the way its developer intends. This article explains how <strong>HTML</strong> can be used to provide <a href="./src/fundamental.html" target="_blank" >fundamental</a> page structure by defining headings and paragraphs.

    <h2 align="center">Structuring content with HTML</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>HTML</strong> is the technology that defines the content and structure of any website. Written properly, it should also define the semantics (meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way, which is vital for accessibility, search engine optimization, and making use of the built-in features browsers provide for content to work <a href="./src/optimally.html" target="_blank" >optimally</a>. This module covers the basics of the language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.
