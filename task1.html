    <h3>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
      Web. 
      <hr>
      It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
      technologies besides <strong>HTML</strong> are generally used to describe a web page's
      appearance/presentation <i>CSS</i> or functionality/behavior <i>JavaScript</i>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
    <mark>Hypertext</mark> refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

    <p>
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by <code>< and ></code>. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code>< title ></code> tag can be written as <code>< Title ></code> <code> < TITLE > <code>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

Basic HTML syntax

    Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!
