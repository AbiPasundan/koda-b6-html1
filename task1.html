    <h3>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
      Web. 
      <hr>
      It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
      technologies besides <strong>HTML</strong> are generally used to describe a web page's
      appearance/presentation <i>CSS</i> or functionality/behavior <i>JavaScript</i>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
    <mark>Hypertext</mark> refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

    <p>
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by <code>< and ></code>. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code>< title ></code> tag can be written as <code>< Title ></code> <code> < TITLE > <code>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
